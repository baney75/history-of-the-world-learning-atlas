# Pitfalls and Prevention Rules

## 2026-02-18 - Generic image placeholders reduced credibility
- Pitfall: symbolic SVGs looked polished but were often not period-specific.
- Prevention: prefer real historical images with explicit provenance and descriptive alt text.

## 2026-02-18 - Source links were too indirect
- Pitfall: many sections relied on generalized source links.
- Prevention: each period must include direct, section-relevant references (Scripture passages, archives, or reputable historical entries).

## 2026-02-18 - Overstating test coverage
- Pitfall: easy to imply tests ran when no test framework exists.
- Prevention: explicitly state current testing reality and run only verifiable checks (`bun run lint`, `bun run build`).
