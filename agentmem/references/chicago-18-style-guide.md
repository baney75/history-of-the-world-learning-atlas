 Chicago 18th style sheet
We recommend that you use this style sheet in conjunction with your School’s style guide and the
guidance available via Cite them Right Online. For general help with referencing see the Academic
Skills Kit.

You’ll find further information on using Chicago on The Chicago Manual of Style Quick Guide and in
The Chicago Manual of Style.

Chicago style rules

There are two formats within the Chicago referencing style, notes and bibliography (NB), and
author-date. NB is most often used at Newcastle University. For information on the author-date
version of the style, see the Chicago Manual of Style.

Citation

Chicago NB is a footnote style. A superscript number is placed in the text and a citation is placed in
the corresponding footnote below your text. The first line of footnotes should be indented by ½
inch (1.27cm). For example:

In the text:

Recent research shows that creating a search plan is the ideal.1

In the footnote:

1 Jonathan Grix and Gerald Watkins, Information skills: finding and using the right

resources (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), 3.

The first time you cite a source, full details are given in the footnote. A short citation, featuring the
author’s surname, first few words of the title, plus a page number if relevant, can be given for
subsequent entries. For example:

1 Grix and Watkins, Information skills, 4.

The 18th edition of Chicago discourages the use of ibid. Short citations should be used instead.

Visit Cite them Right Online for more information on how to format your footnotes.

Bibliography

Your bibliography should contain the full reference for all information sources cited and read,
arranged alphabetically by surname of the first author (not numerically).

Unlike in the footnote, the name of the first listed author of a source is given as, surname,
forename. Following authors or editors are given as, forename, surname. Arrange sources with no
author alphabetically by title.

References should be formatted with a hanging indent (all lines after the first are indented half an
inch (1.27cm) from the left margin.)

Citing ChatGPT and other generative AI

Cite Them Right have given guidance on how to reference generative AI. See also official guidance
in the Chicago Manual of Style (14.112).

If you have used AI to generate content, note the use of the AI programme in your text:

In-text citation example:

When prompted by the author, ChatGPT responded with a ‘definition of academic success’ as
follows...

To cite in a footnote, summarise the prompts you have used:

Footnote format:

Prompt, Name of AI, Month day, year, Developer, URL if publicly available.

For example:

1.  Response to “Provide a definition of academic success,” ChatGPT, June 28, 2023.

Only include an entry in your bibliography if the generated content is publicly accessible.

FAQs

How do I cite and reference a source quoted in another author’s work?

This is called secondary referencing. First, we recommend that you try to locate and read the
original (primary) source – this will ensure you are not taking the information out of context and
allow you to reference the source as normal.

If you cannot find the original source (it may be out of print, unavailable or in a language you
cannot read), then provide a reference to the secondary source in your bibliography and refer to
the original source in your footnote using ‘quoted in’ or ‘cited in’.

For example:

The study by the University of Warwick found a clear correlation between the productivity of
employees and their happiness.1

1 Andrew J. Oswald, Eugenio Proto, and Daniel Sgroi, cited in Alex Bryson and George MacKerron, “Are you

happy while you work?,” The Economic Journal 127 (2015): 124, https://academic-oup-
com.libproxy.ncl.ac.uk/ej/article/127/599/106/5067823.

Only cite the source you read in your bibliography.

How many authors do I include in my footnotes and bibliography?

You include up to two authors in your footnote, for example:

1. Borden, Sandra L., and Chad Tew. “The Role of Journalist and the Performance of

Journalism: Ethical Lessons From "Fake" News (Seriously).” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 22,
no. 4 (2007): 300–314.

If there are three or more authors, you can use et al. (meaning ‘and others’) in your footnote, for
example:

1. Sue Hobbs et al., Academic Skills: Listening, Speaking, and Study Skills, (Oxford:

Oxford University Press, 2011), 44.

ncl.ac.uk/library

6

List all for up to six authors in your bibliography; if there are more than 6 authors, list the first 3
followed by et al.

How do I reference sources that have the same author?

In the 18th edition, Chicago no longer recommends using the 3-em dash for repeated author names.
Instead, you should repeat the authors name and list items alphabetically by title. For example:

Burn, Andrew. R. Agricola and Roman Britain. New York: Collier Books, 1962.

Burn, Andrew. R. The Romans in Britain: An Anthology of Inscriptions: With Translations and a
Running Commentary. 2nd ed. Oxford: Blackwell, 1969.
